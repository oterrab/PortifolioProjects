**üìà BIREFING**

- This course aims to teach SQL in a pratical way. Every topic is teached on video and after that, the couse gives a challenge that I had to do it by myself. Thats why some of the queries are a little off topic. It was me exploring learning possibilities within the lesson.

**‚úèÔ∏è OBJECTIVE**

- Be able to use Oracle SQL to retrieve, filter, analyze, format and present information from Oracle databases.
- Understand Oracle SQL code written by other people and feel confident to modify it.
- Be able to use SQL to insert, modify and delete information from Oracle databases.
- Be able to write the SQL code needed to solve the most common problems found in real work situations and academic tests.


**üìà ENVIROMENT SETUP**

- [Oracle LIVE SQL](https://livesql.oracle.com/)

## Subqueries

**Content**

- Subqueries
- Inline Views
- Subquery Factoring (WITH clause) 
- Top-N Queries
- Row Limiting Clause.


### üìå Q1: Query to display all of the detail of the department where the youngest employee n the company works.


```sql
select *
from department
where department.id = (select department_id
                       from employee
                       where birthdate = (select max(birthdate) 
                                          from employee)
);
```

**Result:**  
<img width="382" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-18 at 22 53 46" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/179647406-289d91d3-fa5d-46dc-b69d-82085e686128.png">

### üìå Q2: Query to list the names of the departments along with the average salary and the birthdate of the oldest employee that works in each department.

```sql
select d.name, avg(e.salary) as average_salary, max(e.birthdate) as oldest_employee
from department d, employee e
where d.id = e.department_id
group by d.name;
```

<img width="408" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-18 at 22 53 26" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/179647750-625381af-6aef-4a5d-875e-6a49bc7fca18.png">

### üìå Q3: Query to list the names of the departments **that exist in the company**, along with the average salary and the birthdate of the oldest employee that works in each department **ordered by department id in descending order**.

```sql
select name, (
    select avg(salary) 
    from employee e 
    where e.department_id = d.id
    ) as average_salary, 
    (
    select min(birthdate) 
    from employee e 
    where e.department_id = d.id
    ) as oldest_employee
from department d
order by d.id desc;
```

**Result:**  
<img width="405" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-18 at 22 52 05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/179647017-263edb75-367d-403a-91ef-dccba4171dd5.png">

### üìå Q4: Query to list the max, min, and average of salaries for every department id in the employee table, but include only departments whose max salary is greater than the double of their minimum salary.

**RESTRICTION: Not allowed to use a HAVING clause.**

```sql
select *
from ( 
select department_id, max(salary) as max_salary, min(salary) as min_salary, avg(salary) as average_salary
from employee
group by department_id
     ) e
where e.max_salary >= 2*e.min_salary;
```

**This time using the HAVING clause.**

```sql
select department_id, max(salary) as max_salary, min(salary) as min_salary, avg(salary) as average_salary
from employee
group by department_id
having max(salary) >= 2*min(salary);
```

**This time using subquery factoring (WITH clause) instead of an inline view. RESTRICTION: Not allowed to use a HAVING clause.**

```sql
with subquery_salary (department_id, max_salary, min_salary, average_salary)
as (
select department_id, max(salary) , min(salary), avg(salary)
from employee
group by department_id
)
select *
from subquery_salary
where max_salary >= 2*min_salary;
```
**Result:**  
<img width="399" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-18 at 22 50 04" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/179646826-cdaba31f-e617-405b-8ca7-806fe99284fe.png">


### üìå Q5: Query that uses the rownum pseudocolumn to get the top 5 earners in the employee table

```sql

```
**Result:**  
<img width="421" alt="Q5" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/179644679-becbe6a8-6d5e-4c52-8af9-7347b45f5c88.png">

### üìå Q6: Query to list the names of the departments that exist in the company, along with the average salary and the birthdate of the oldest employee that works in each department ordered by department id in descending order.

```sql

```
**Result:**  
<img width="421" alt="Q6" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/179646234-aec04ac5-25e9-4384-b0cc-60e6edec832e.png">
