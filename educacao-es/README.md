# Portifolio Project - Educação ES

In this code I analysed educational data from my home state. The educational data consist in state schools and students who passed, failed and those who dropped out of school.

This is an analisys of schools per counties aggregating them by their unique school number called INEP.

Also did a count of unique schools shifts. Some schools offer more than one shift and in total the file have 97027 shift  observations over several years (2008-2022). So I isolated unique shifts grouped by INEP for the year of 2022.
