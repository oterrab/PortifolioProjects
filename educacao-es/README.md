# Portifolio Project - Educação ES

In this code I analysed educational data from my home state using data from Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (INEP). The institute is responsible for promoting studies, research and periodic evaluations on the Brazilian educational system, with the objective of subsidizing the formulation and implementation of public policies for the educational area.

This is an analisys of elementary schools per cities aggregating them by their administrative instance (municipal, state, federal or private).

**Elementary**

**Middle School**

Also did a count of unique schools shifts. Some schools offer more than one shift and in total the file have 97027 shift  observations over several years (2008-2022). So I isolated unique shifts grouped by INEP for the year of 2022.
