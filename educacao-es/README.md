# Portifolio Project - Educação ES

In this code I analysed educational data from my home state. The educational data consist in state schools and students who passed, failed and those who dropped out of school.

This is an analisys of schools per counties aggregating them by their unique school number called INEP.

Also did a count of observations in each schools shift. Some schools offer more than one shift and in total the file have 97027 observations. That's why the number is so high compared with the previous image.
