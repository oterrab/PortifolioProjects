# Portifolio Project - Educação ES :school_satchel: :memo:

In this code I analysed educational data from my home state using data from Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (INEP). The institute is responsible for promoting studies, research and periodic evaluations on the Brazilian educational system, with the objective of subsidizing the formulation and implementation of public policies for the educational area.

This is an analisys of elementary schools per cities aggregating them by their administrative instance (municipal, state, federal or private).

**Middle School**

As expected most of elementary teaching is done by the city administrative instance while most of middle school teaching is done by the state administrative instance. The federal constitution defines that the municipality takes care of early childhood education and also elementary school 1; Middle school is a priority for the state government, but they also manage elementary schoool 2. The union, in turn, is responsible for the financial and technical coordination while conducting the federal universities.

Also did an analyze of number of students per public school in elementary and middle school.

I also used TCU ES data to see the expenses each city had on education.

![Expenses per City Relative to FUNDEB](output/images/despesas_educacionais.png)

Total public resources invested in maintenance and development of education divided by the number of students enrolled in the public education network. The higher the position in the ranking, the greater the investment in maintenance and development of education per student in the municipal network.
