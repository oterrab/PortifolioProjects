# Portifolio Projects to Learn Programming and Data Science

These will be my forays into learning techniques for data science. I'll track my
projects here with a quick note on what each project does.

## Natural Language Processing - NLP

In this code I used NLP techniques to interpret text data that I was working with in my PhD and to learn some techniques I was going to use in other context. The text used to perform this analysis was a transcript of a chemistry class for undergraduation students.

I've started with pre-processing techniques including tokenization, text normalization and data cleaning. Once in a standard format, various regular and machine learning techniques can be applied to better understand the data. First I did a classic word cloud to visualize the text.

Also worked with modeling techniques to score the sentiment of a text. To perform a sentiment analysis, I did a subjectivity score to understand how much the teacher speech was opiniated (if what he was saying was a objective fact or a subjective opinion) and a polarity score to understand if what he is talking is negative or positive.
