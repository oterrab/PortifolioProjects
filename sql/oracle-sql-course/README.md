**üìà BIREFING**

- This course aims to teach SQL in a pratical way. Every topic is teached on video and after that, the couse gives a challenge that I had to do it by myself. Thats why some of the queries are a little off topic. It was me exploring learning possibilities within the lesson.

**‚úèÔ∏è OBJECTIVE**

- Be able to use Oracle SQL to retrieve, filter, analyze, format and present information from Oracle databases.
- Understand Oracle SQL code written by other people and feel confident to modify it.
- Be able to use SQL to insert, modify and delete information from Oracle databases.
- Be able to write the SQL code needed to solve the most common problems found in real work situations and academic tests.


**üìà ENVIROMENT SETUP**

- [Oracle LIVE SQL](https://livesql.oracle.com/)

    name,
    phone,
    salary
from employee;
```

#### üìå C2: Retrieve all of the information available in the department table.

```sql
select *
from department;
```

#### üìå C3: The company is going to give all employees a 20% increase in their salaries, and your task is to display a list of all of the employees which includes the employee id, the name, the current salary, and the salary they will have after the 20% increase.

### Filtering

<br/>

#### üìå C4: Display a list of departments whose monthly budget is greater than or equal to 20,000. Please include only the department name and its budget.

```sql
select name,monthly_budget
from department
where monthly_budget >= 20000;
```

#### üìå C5: Display a list of employees who were born before 1990, which includes the name, phone, and birthdate.

```sql
select Name, phone, birthdate
from employee
where birthdate < date '1990-01-01';
```


#### üìå C6: The company is planning to give some employees a special gift, but they will consider only employees that work in the accounting and marketing departments.  For employees of those departments, the condition is that they must earn less than 3000 a month, or have been born before the year 1985.  Your task consists of displaying the list of employees that can participate.

Hint: List the contents of the department table to see the IDs you have to use in your condition to return only the marketing and accounting departments.

```sql
select *
from employee
where department_id = 1 or department_id = 2 and salary < 3000 or birthdate < date '1995-01-01';
```

### Understanding and Handling NULLs

<br/>

<details>

<br/>
	
**Comparing NULLs:**	
<p align="justify">The SQL NULL value serves a special purpose. To maintain the integrity of a database, it represents a non-existent value AND an unknown value.</p>

<p align="justify">TSQL uses a Ternary logic. Binary logic uses two values: True and False, 0 and 1, etc. Ternary logic uses three values True, False and Unknown. Because of that, logical operation involving a NULL results in a value of unknown. In this sense, any logical operation involving a NULL results in a value of unknown except for TRUE OR NULL and FALSE AND NULL because the TRUE/FALSE will be valid, but you will be actually testing 'TRUE/FALSE or UNKNOWN'. That means that the only way to compare NULLs correctly is by means of the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators. They return only true or false and are the best practice for incorporating NULL values into your queries. </p>

**Operating NULLs:**	
<p align="justify">Be very careful when you perform operations with numeric columns that might contains NULLs. Its better to be forewarned and write the query with that in mind or it might give you problems in the future. Thats because Numeric Value x NULL = Unknown.</p>

</details>

<br/>

#### üìå C7: The company has a cell phone that is assigned to the employee who is in charge of server support. All employees in the company can do that job, and they switch positions constantly, so the person in charge of support can change at any time, but you can identify it by means of their phone number. The phone number for the server support person is ‚Äò1.234.567.8901‚Äô. Your task is to write a query to list ALL employees whose salary is greater than 4000, but you don‚Äôt have to include the person currently in charge of server support.

```sql
-- SOLUTION 1
select *
from employee
where salary > 4000
and (phone != '1.234.567.8901'
or phone is null);
```

```sql
-- SOLUTION 2
select *
from employee
where salary > 4000
and LNNVL(phone = '1.234.567.8901');
```

### NULL Handling Functions

<br/>

<details> 
<summary>

</summary>
	
<br/>

**NVL vs COALESCE:**	
<p align="justify">The NVL function is Oracle specific and only accepts two expressions as input. If the first expression is null, the function returns the second expression. Otherwise, the first expression will be returned. The input expressions can also be of different types, if this happens an implicit cast attempt will be made, if the cast is not possible an error will be returned. Also, this function always evaluates the two input expressions, making it slightly less performant than COALESCE.Illustration of the NVL function:</p>

![NVL](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/181266679-fca576cd-adad-4d13-87ee-7348e9c899ca.gif)

<p align="justify">COALESCE is part of the ANSI-92 standard, so it is a function that exists in all databases that follow this standard or higher. It always returns the first non-null value in the expression list. You must specify at least two expressions, but you can specify more. Illustration of the COALESCE function:</p>

![COALESCE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/181266644-049f5c01-0a06-4455-95d2-351977d4214c.gif)

**NVL vs NVL2:**	
<p align="justify">NVL checks if first argument is null and returns second argument. NVL2 has different logic. If first argument is not null then NVL2 returns second argument, but in other case it will return third argument</p>

</details>

<br/>

#### üìå C8: Write a query to get a list of companies from the COMPANY table, which includes the following columns. Please define the appropriate aliases so that the columns are shown in the results as mentioned here:

COMPANY_NAME

CONTACT_NAME: The commercial contact if we have it. If we don‚Äôt have the commercial contact, then return the technical contact. If we don‚Äôt have the technical contact, return the president, and if we don‚Äôt have the president either, return ‚Äò*NO CONTACT DATA*‚Äô.

BUDGET: The budget, if we have it. If we don‚Äôt have it, then return the budget range start. Restriction: You must use NVL to generate this column.

```sql
select 
	name as company_name, 
	coalesce(commercial_contact, technical_contact, president, '*NO CONTACT DATA*') as contact_name, 
	NVL(budget, budget_range_start) as budget
from company;
```

#### üìå C9: Someone from our commercial department has been calling the companies stored in the COMPANY table, to confirm if the budgets we have stored are correct, and when that has not been the case, they have immediately made the necessary corrections to the data. As a result, we know that whenever we have any date in the LAST_CONTACTED column, it means that the budget stored in the BUDGET column for that company is correct. If the last_contacted column has NULL, it means we have never contacted that company. Write a query to generate a list of companies with the following information, but don‚Äôt include companies we contacted before the year 2019. The companies must be ordered by the last contacted date in ascending order, but companies we have never contacted must appear first.

Please make sure that the column names are shown in the results as mentioned here.

COMPANY NAME

EXCLUSIVELY_COMMERCIAL_CONTACT: The commercial contact of the company, but only if it is different from the technical contact. If the commercial contact is the same as the technical contact, then this column must be returned as null.

BUDGET: The budget, but only if we know the value is correct. If we have not confirmed that the budget info we have is correct, then return the budget_range_start.

LAST_CONTACTED_DATE

Restrictions:

1. The use of the logical operators AND/OR is not allowed.

2. You are only allowed to use null-handling functions. No other type of function or expression is allowed in the SELECT list or WHERE clause.


```sql
select 
    name as company_name, 
    NULLIF(commercial_contact, technical_contact) as exclusively_commercial_contact, 
    NVL2(last_contacted, budget, budget_range_start) as budget, 
    last_contacted as last_contacted_date
from company
where LNNVL(last_contacted < date '2019-01-01')
order by last_contacted nulls first;
```

### SQL Operators

#### üìå C10: Write a query to get the list of employees whose name includes the letter ‚ÄúO‚Äù 2 times, but not contiguously, so if there was a name ‚ÄúJOHN DOE‚Äù, it should be returned, but a row with name ‚ÄúJIM BROOKS‚Äù should not, because the 2 Os are contiguous.

Note: Since at this point we still don‚Äôt have the necessary knowledge to count the number of ‚ÄòO‚Äôs that appear in a string, assume that no name will contain more than 2 Os.

```sql
select *
from employee
where name like '%O_%O%';
```

#### üìå C12: Write a query to list all employees of the Information Technology and Human Resources departments who earn 3000 or more but not more than 5000. Please include only employees who were born between 1970 and 1990.

```sql
select *

### Logical Operators

<br/>

#### üìå C13: Write a query to list all employees who were born before 01-jan-1980 or after 01-jan-1995 and earn more than 2000 a month, and whose name does not start or end with an ‚ÄúN‚Äù.

When evaluating the condition about how much they earn, please take into account the BONUS column too, which was added with the script provided in the resources section of the lesson about UNDERSTANDING NULLS.

```sql
select *
from employee
where salary + nvl(bonus,0) > 2000
  and
  (birthdate < date '1980-01-01'
    or birthdate > date '1995-01-01')
  and not
  (name like '%N'
    or name like 'N%');

### Substitution Variables

<br/>


Warning: As mentioned in the lesson, the ability to use substitution variables is a feature of SQL Developer (and some other client tools), but this feature is not implemented by Live SQL and Apex, so if you try to run statements with substitution variables there you will get errors.

#### üìå C14: ~~Write a query to list employees who were hired between a certain range of dates (for example, between January 1st, 2011, and December 15th, 2014). The query must be written in a way that allows the user to use a different date range without needing to modify the query.~~


#### üìå C15: ~~Write a query to list employees who work in a given department. The query must prompt the user to enter a value, and then return only employees whose salary is equal to the value entered, or equal to the half of the value entered or equal to a third of the value entered by the user.~~

~~The query must also prompt for the id of the department that the user wants to list.~~

~~Your script must include the command necessary to erase the value entered for the salary so that if the query is executed again, the user is prompted for the salary value again.~~

### Aggregate Functions

<br/>

#### üìå C16: Write a query to get the number of employees in the Accounting department, the total sum of their salaries, and the average salary. The average must appear 2 times in the results, one of them must be calculated using the AVG function, and one without using the AVG function. Please add column aliases to make it easy to understand the columns in the result.

```sql
select
    count(*) as emps,
    sum(salary) as sum_salary,
    sum(salary)/count(*) as average_salary1,
    avg(salary) as average_salary2
from employee
where department_id = 1;

## Subqueries in SQL

<br/>

<details> 
<summary>
Click here for study notes on key concepts. üîë</p>
	
</summary>
	
<br/>
	
**Correlated Subqueries:**
<p align="justify"> Correlated subqueries are used for row-by-row processing. Each subquery is executed once for every row of the outer query. A correlated subquery is one way of reading every row in a table and comparing values in each row against related data. Because the subquery may be evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query, it can be slow. It is used whenever a subquery must return a different result or set of results for each candidate row considered by the outer query (main query). For example, return a value necessary to compare with each employee (aka, a row) as in C3. In this sense, a correlated subquery requires values from its outer query (main query) in order to execute, and if you try to run it separately, you have to substitute at least one of the values. </p>
	
**Non-Correlated Subqueries:**	
<p align="justify">Non-correlated subqueries are those that are totally independent of the main statement. The subquery executes first, and then passes its results to the outer query.</p>
	
**Scalar Subqueries:**	
<p align="justify">A scalar subquery is a subquery expression that can return a maximum of one value and can be either correlated or non-correlated. It is correlated when it returns a single value for each row of its correlated outer table set, as in **C3**. And it is non-correlated when it returns a single value to its containing query, as in C1. </p>

### CTE
**a.k.a. Subqueries Factoring or WITH Clause**

<br/>

#### üìå C23: Query to list the max, min, and average of salaries for every department id in the employee table, but include only departments whose max salary is greater than the double of their minimum salary.

This time **using subquery factoring (WITH clause)** instead of an inline view.  
RESTRICTION: Not allowed to use a HAVING clause.

```sql
with subquery_salary (department_id, max_salary, min_salary, average_salary)
as (
select department_id, max(salary) , min(salary), avg(salary)
from employee
group by department_id

<br/>

### Row Limiting Clause

<br/>

#### üìå C27: Query that segments the employee table in pages, based on the salary in ascending order, and returns the third page. The size of each page must be 4 rows.

WARNING: The row limiting clause was introduced in version 12c.

```sql
select *

**Implicit Conversions:**
<p align="justify">Implicit conversions occur when SQL Server has to do a conversion from one data type to another data type to be able to make a comparison and that conversion wasn't specified in the query. These hidden conversions can be a performance killer, especially if SQL Server has to apply them to every row to perform that comparison. One easy way to see this implicit conversion is with the sql_variant data type. Any comparison to a value that is of that type requires a conversion.</p>

```sql	
/* This requires an implicit conversion, 
because the column 'period' in this example is deined as varchar2 and we are comparing with a number. 
So, oracle applies TO_NUMBER() to the column: */

SELECT *
FROM monthly.account.balance
WHERE period =  201811 and client_id = 100;
```
 
```sql	
/* This does not require an implict conversion. 
Because we are explicitly converting to varchar and it runs 20x faster. */

SELECT *
FROM monthly.account.balance
WHERE period =  '201811' and client_id = 100;
```

### Text Functions

<br/>

#### üìå C28: We need to make some changes to the data about our employees, but before applying the changes we need to see the data as it will be after the changes. Please write a query to list employees data with the following changes:

 - The names of all of the employees must be stored with the first letter of each name in uppercase, and the rest of the name in lowercase.
 - The e-mail addresses are incorrect.  All of them must be modified to add ‚Äú@gmail.com‚Äù to the string they currently have, but the current value must be changed to lowercase.
 - Phone numbers have dots, but we want them replaced by hyphens.
 - We need a new column called ‚ÄúCODE‚Äù which will be generated by extracting the part of the name that appears before the first blank space, and then removing all vowels from it, so, for an employee called ‚ÄòCARLOS‚Äô the code would be ‚ÄòCRLS‚Äô.
 
```sql
select id,
  initcap(name) as name,
  birthdate,
  replace(phone,'.','-') as phone,
  salary,
  department_id,
  hire_date,
  job_id,
  lower(email) || '@gmail.com' as email,
  translate(substr(name,1,instr(name,' ')-1),'*AEIOU','*') as code
from employee;
```

#### üìå C29: Write a query to generate a list of employees following these requirements:

 - We don‚Äôt need the complete phone number. In this report, we only want the numbers that are between the first and second dots, for example, for a number like this 515.123.4567 the report must display ‚Äò123‚Äô only.
 - Please don‚Äôt include employees hired before 2010.
 - The report must be ordered by salary, in descending order.
 
```sql
select  id,
  name,
  birthdate,
  phone,
  substr(phone, instr(phone, '.')+1, to_number(instr(phone,'.',1,2) - instr(phone,'.')-1)) as phone,
  salary,
  department_Id,
  hire_date,
  job_id,
  email
from Employee
where hire_date >= to_date('01-01-2010', 'dd-mm-yyyy')
order by salary desc;

### Numeric Functions

<br/>

#### üìå C30: Write the query needed to generate a report with the following characteristics. For this task assume that a month has 30 days:

- The report must include the names, job_id, salary, daily salary, and the result of applying the round, trunc, ceil and floor functions to the daily salary calculation.

- The report must include only employees whose daily salary is an integer and either were hired after 2010 or work for the ‚ÄòIT‚Äô department.


```sql
select name, 
       job_id, 
       salary, 
       (salary/30) as daily_salary,
       round(salary/30),
       trunc(salary/30),
       ceil(salary/30),
       floor(salary/30)

<br/>

#### üìå C31: Write the query necessary to generate the report with the following characteristics:

- The report must include the employee id, name, and hire date.

- It must include a column that tells us for how many months the employee has worked for the company.

- Every employee receives a raise after 6 months of working for the company. Include a column that tells us the date in which they earned the right for the mentioned raise.

- Every employee is sent to a short induction the next Monday after they are hired. Include a column that tells us the date in which they attended their induction.

- Every employee is subscribed to the company‚Äôs monthly newsletter on the first day of the next month after they are hired. Add a column that tells us the date in which they were subscribed to the newsletter.

- Do not include employees from the IT department.

 
```sql
select
    id,
    name,
    hire_date,
    trunc(months_between(sysdate, hire_date)) as months_worked,
    add_months(hire_date, 6) as raise_earned_date,

**Formating:**
<p align="justify">The format element for minutes is 'MI' and not 'MM'. Careful, using MM will not give any error, it will just mix months in the time portion of your results. This can go unotice for a long time!</p>
</details>

#### üìå C32: Generate a report of all of the employees who were born after 1970 and for whom we have a phone number registered. In the report, the department_id must be displayed using 4 digits, left-padded with zeros. The salary must be displayed with your local currency symbol and 2 decimals and with commas as the thousands separator.

Please add an additional column called ‚ÄúALT_BIRTHDATE‚Äù that will result from swapping the month and day parts of the birthdate, so, for example, if the birthdate is 10-Mar-2015, the alternate birthdate would be 03-Oct-2015 (the day becomes the month and the month becomes the day). If the resulting date is invalid, this column should return NULL.
 
```sql
select name,birthdate,phone,
  to_char(department_id,'fm0000') as department_id,
  to_char(salary,'fmL99,990.00') as salary,
  to_date(to_char(birthdate,'ddmmyyyy') default null on conversion error,'mmddyyyy') as alt_birthdate
from employee e
where trunc(birthdate, 'yy') >= to_date(1970, 'yyyy')
--where birthdate > to_date('31-12-1969', 'dd-mm-yyyy')
and phone is not null;

#### üìå C33: Generate a second report that includes all of the employees that were hired before 2015 and earn more than 2500 or were hired in 2015 but earn less than 3000. The report must include the employees‚Äô names, the day and month of the birthdate, and only the month (name of the month) and year of the hire date.

The company is planning to give every employee a surprise bonus for the amount of the last 4 digits of their phone number, so please include an additional column that displays the amount of this bonus for every employee. This amount must be displayed with your local currency symbol and 2 decimals.

They will receive this surprise bonus in the month that corresponds to the last digit of their phone number, so, for example, if the employee‚Äôs phone number ends with a 4, it means that he must receive his bonus in April. Please include an additional column that tells us the name of the month in which they must receive their bonus. If any employee has a phone number that ends in a number that is not a valid month, they must receive their bonus in December.
 
```sql
select 
    name,
    to_char(birthdate,'dd/mm') as birthdate,
    to_char(hire_date,'fmMonth yyyy') as hire_date,
    to_char(to_number(substr(phone,-4)),'L9990.00') as bonus,
    to_char(to_date(substr(phone,-1) default '12' on conversion error,'mm'),'Month') as bonus_month
from employee
where trunc(hire_date, 'yyyy') < to_date('01-01-2015', 'dd-mm-yyyy') and salary > 2500
or trunc(hire_date, 'yyyy') = to_date('01-01-2015', 'dd-mm-yyyy') and salary < 3000;

#### üìå C34: The company wants to give a rise to all employees according to these conditions:

- Employees who work in the ACCOUNTING department get a 10% increase to their salary.

- Employees who work in the MARKETING department get a 15% increase to their salary.

- Employees from the other departments get a 20% increase to their salary.

Please generate a report that includes the employee id, name, current salary, and new salary. Please generate 2 columns for the new salary. To calculate the first one use the DECODE function and for the second one use a simple CASE expression. The result in both new salary columns must be the same.
 
```sql
select
    id,
    name,
    salary as current_salary,
    salary + (salary * decode(department_id,1,0.10,2,0.15,0.20)) as new_salary_1,

#### üìå C35: The company is planning to assign a classification to each employee based on the salary they earn. The classification would be as follows:

- Employees who earn less than 2500 will be classified as ‚ÄúA‚Äù.

- Employees who earn 2500 or more but less than 4000 will be classified as ‚ÄúB‚Äù.

- Employees who earn 4000 or more will be classified as ‚ÄúC‚Äù if they were hired before 2014 and will be classified as ‚ÄúD‚Äù if they were hired in 2014 or 2015.

Please generate a report that includes the employee id, name, salary, the year they were hired, and the classification of each employee, but don‚Äôt include employees from the MARKETING department, and also don‚Äôt include employees who don‚Äôt have a phone number registered. The report must be ordered by salary and hire_date.

#### üìå C36: Write an employees report with the following columns:

- Id

- Name

- Date of their second birthday (don‚Äôt use functions to calculate this date, and assume that all years have 365 days (ignore the possibility of leap years), so the result will actually be an approximation of the second birthday date.)

- How old they were when they were hired. Their age must be expressed in hours (not years).

Please include only employees who were hired in 1980 or later and whose phone number starts with ‚Äú1‚Äù. Order results by department id (ascending) and salary (descending).
 
```sql
select
    id,

</summary>

#### üìå Interesting Example: Write a query that tells the number of employees hired in the years of 2014 and 2015 for each department. First example is made in traditional way, second example is made using pivot clause.
 
```sql
select 
    department_id,
    count( 
            case to_char(hire_date, 'YYYY')
            when '2014' then 1

    count( 
            case to_char(hire_date, 'YYYY')
            when '2015' then 1
            end ) as "2015"
from employee
group by department_id
order by department_id;
```

<br/>

```sql
select *

<br/>
	
**Why MAX()?**

<p align="justify">You need an aggregate function. Depending on what you want to do, it could be MAX, MIN, AVG, etc‚Ä¶

Sometimes you don‚Äôt want to aggregate anything, because you are working with a single row for each value. In those cases, you can use some function like MAX or MIN just to comply with the requirement of using an aggregate function, but because there is only one row for each value, the results would be correct.</p>

### Unpivot

<br/>

#### üìå C38: Write a query to generate a list of employees who work in the Accounting and Marketing departments. The report must include the name, birthdate, and hire_date, but each employee must appear in the report 2 times, and the birth date and hire date must appear in the same column but in different rows. This column must be called ‚Äúdate_value‚Äù and there must be an additional column that explains the kind of date that is included in the date_value column. This additional column must be called ‚Äúdate_type‚Äù and will contain either ‚ÄúDate of Birth‚Äù or ‚ÄúDate of Hiring‚Äù.
 
```sql
select name,date_type,date_value

</summary>
<br/>
	
**Aggregate Functions vs Analytic Functions:** <br/>
<p align="justify">Aggregate functions (count, avg, sum, min, max, etc..) perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Analytic functions compute an aggregate value based on a set of values, and, unlike aggregate functions, can return multiple rows for each set of values. Aggregate functions can be used as analytic function when you use the windows function (over() clause) since can return multiple rows.</p>

<br/>

### Partition Clause

<br/>

#### üìå C39: Write a query to generate a list of employees with the following characteristics:

¬∑ All employees must be returned.

¬∑ The report must include the following columns from the table: Id, name, department_id, email.

¬∑ The report must also include the following calculated columns: The length of the email. The number of employees from the same department who have an email of the same length.

¬∑ The report must be ordered by department_id and length of the email column.


```sql
select 
    id,
    name,
    department_id,
    email,
    length(email) as length_email,
    count(*) over (partition by (length(email)), department_id) as CNT_elength

### Window Function

<br/>
<details> 
<summary>
Click here for study notes on key concepts. üîë</p>
	
</summary>
<br/>
	
**What is a Window Function?** <br/>
<p align="justify">A window functions perform calculations over a set of rows (known as a ‚Äúwindow‚Äù) and return a single value for each row from the underlying query. A window (or windowing or windowed) function makes use of the values from the rows in a window to calculate the returned values. When you use a window function in a query, define the window using the OVER() clause. The OVER() clause (window definition) differentiates window functions from other analytical and reporting functions. A query can include multiple window functions with the same or different window definitions. If a function has an OVER clause, then it is a window function. If it lacks an OVER clause, then it is an ordinary aggregate or scalar function. Window functions might also have a FILTER clause in between the function and the OVER clause.</p>

Named window-defn clauses may also be added to a SELECT statement using a WINDOW clause and then referred to by name within window function invocations. For example, the following SELECT statement contains two named window-defs clauses, "win1" and "win2":

```sql
SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER win1, rank() OVER win2 
FROM t0 
WINDOW win1 AS (ORDER BY y RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW),
       win2 AS (PARTITION BY y ORDER BY x)
ORDER BY x;
```
	
**Partition Clause vs Window Function:** <br/>
<p align="justify">Partition is static, once you define the partition it does not change. But the windows can change or move as we process diferent rows. In this sense, when used together, windows move inside the partitions.</p>
</details>


#### üìå C40: Write a query to generate a report of the employees, which includes at least the following columns:

¬∑ Id

¬∑ Name

¬∑ Hire_date,

¬∑ A count of the number of employees hired in the same year of the current employee or in the previous year.

The results must be ordered by the hire date.
 
```sql
-- SOLUTION 1
select
    id,
    name,
    department_id,
    salary,
    hire_date,
    count(*) over(
    order by to_number(to_char(hire_date, 'yyyy'))
    range 1 preceding
    ) as counts
from employee;

-- SOLUTION 2
select
    id,
    name,
    department_id,
    salary,
    hire_date,
    count(*) over(
    order by extract(year from hire_date)
    range 1 preceding

### Common Analytic Functions
- **Observation:** The course author is refering to sum, count, min, max, etc.. when used with over(). Since they can return multiple rows for each set of values, they become analytic functions by definition.

<br/>

#### üìå C41: Write a query to generate a list of all of the departments including their ID, name, and monthly budget, but also include a column that shows the accumulated budget (the sum of the budget of previous departments plus the current one). To decide the order in which the budgets are accumulated you must sort them by smallest to greatest budget.
 
```sql
select 
    id,
    name,
    monthly_budget,
    sum(monthly_budget) over (order by monthly_budget) as accumulated_mb
from department;
```

### Ranking Functions

<br/>

#### üìå C42: Write a query to list all the employees. The result must include their name, department id, hire date, and a column called ‚Äúhire_order‚Äù which is a number that indicates the order in which they were hired. This order is related to the department where they work only, so, the first employee that was hired in each department will have a hire_order of 1.
 
```sql
with hire_order as (
select 
    name,
    department_id,
    hire_date,
    rank() over (partition by department_id order by hire_date) as rn
from employee
)
select *
from hire_order;

#### üìå C43: Write a query that returns the name, birthdate, and department id of an employee who was born in 1995, preferably from the ACCOUNTING department. If no employee from that department was born in 1995, return one from any other department.
 
```sql
with prioritized as (
select 
    name,
    birthdate,
    department_id,
    row_number() over (order by case 
                                    when department_id = 1 then 'A'
                                    else 'B'

<br/>

### UNION and UNION ALL Operators

<br/>

#### üìå C49: The company wants to send a congratulations letter to employees who were born in the months of May or June, and they also want to send a letter to employees who were hired by the company in those months.

Please write a query to generate the list of employees that have to receive the letters mentioned in the previous paragraph.

The list only needs to include the Id, name, birthdate, and hire_date. Nothing more.

If an employee complies with the conditions to receive both letters, he/she has to be included in the report twice.

Please order the report by employee id.


```sql
select
    id,
    name,
    birthdate,
    hire_date
from employee
where extract(month from birthdate) in(5,6)
union all
select
    id,
    name,
    birthdate,
    hire_date
from employee
where extract(month from hire_date) in(5,6)
order by id;
```

Result:  
<img width="293" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-29 at 12 33 02" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/181793824-2065801e-9a12-4784-ab2c-2ef254a1bce1.png">


### INTERSECT Operator

<br/>

#### üìå C50: Using the same description of the task from the previous lecture, write a compound query to generate the list of employees that should get the 2 letters. Every employee needs to appear only once in this report.

The list only needs to include the Id, name, birthdate, and hire_date. Nothing more.

Reference Description:

The company wants to send a congratulations letter to employees who were born in the months of May or June, and they also want to send a letter to employees who were hired by the company in those months.


```sql
select
    id,
    name,
    birthdate,
    hire_date
from employee
where extract(month from birthdate) in(5,6)
intersect
select
    id,
    name,
    birthdate,
    hire_date
from employee
where extract(month from hire_date) in(5,6)
order by id;
```

Result:  
<img width="289" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-29 at 12 37 10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/181794556-fc14d057-1f5c-4734-8f35-8db8f88f9466.png">



### MINUS Operator

<br/>

#### üìå C51: Using the same description of the task from the previous lecture, write a compound query to generate the list of employees that should get the first letter but not the second one.

The list only needs to include the Id, name, birthdate, and hire_date. Nothing more.

Reference Description:

The company wants to send a congratulations letter to employees who were born in the months of May or June, and they also want to send a letter to employees who were hired by the company in those months.



```sql
select
    id,
    name,
    birthdate,
    hire_date
from employee
where extract(month from birthdate) in(5,6)
minus
select
    id,
    name,
    birthdate,
    hire_date
from employee
where extract(month from hire_date) in(5,6)
order by id;
```

Result:  
<img width="290" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-29 at 12 41 05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/181795224-c3292281-e787-42ce-b505-6352084ccb55.png">



### Combining Set Operators in the Same Query

<br/>

#### üìå C52: The company classifies employees who earn more than 3000 as ‚Äútrusted employees‚Äù. This classification, however, does not apply to employees of the IT department. Write a query to list trusted employees that were hired in 2015.

Restrictions:

You must use SET operators

Each component query can have only one single condition in its WHERE clause (the use of ANDs and ORs is not allowed).



```sql
select
    id,
    name,
    salary,
    hire_date
from employee
where salary > 3000
minus
select
    id,
    name,
    salary,
    hire_date
from employee
where department_id = 3
intersect
select
    id,
    name,
    salary,
    hire_date
from employee
where to_char(hire_date, 'yyyy') = 2015;
```

    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    e.salary,
    j.job_title
from employees e
join jobs j

### Inner Joins

<br/>

#### üìå C55: Write a query to list the ID, name, and salary of all employees who don't work in the 'IT' department, along with their job titles and the name of the department where they work. Please write a version using the new standard syntax, another version using the ‚Äúshort hand‚Äù for the standard syntax, and another version using the old method to write join queries.


```sql
select 
    e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    e.salary,
    j.job_title,
    d.department_name
from employees e
join jobs j 
on e.job_id = j.job_id
join departments d
on d.department_id = e.department_id
where e.department_id != 60
order by employee_id
--offset 0 rows fetch next 15 rows only;
```

### Other Types of Joins

<br/>

#### üìå C56: Write a query that returns a list of employees that includes the employee id, name, and salary along with the name of their manager.

Remember that in the EMPLOYEES table, the column ‚Äúmanager_id‚Äù corresponds to the employee_id of another employee who works as a manager. So if you see an employee with manager_id = 100, it means that in the same EMPLOYEES table, there is an employee whose employee_id is 100, who works as a manager.


```sql
select 
    e1.employee_id,
    e1.first_name,
    e1.last_name,
    e1.salary,
    e1.manager_id,
    e2.first_name as mgr_fn,
    e2.last_name as mgr_ln
from employees e1
join employees e2
on e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
order by employee_id
--offset 0 rows fetch next 15 rows only;
```

- [Hierarchical Operators and Functions](#hierarchical-operators-and-functions)



<br/>

### Hierarchical Query Clause

<br/>

#### üìå C57: Using your employees table, write a query to generate a report of all of the employees, which includes the following columns:

Employee id, first name, last name, and job id of the employee plus first name, last name, and job id of their direct manager.

Order the results by employee id.

```sql

```

Result:  


### Hierarchical Operators and Functions

<br/>

#### üìå C58: Write a query to list the employees that are part of the hierarchy tree for which employee ‚ÄòNeena Kochhar‚Äô is the root. The list must include the employee id, first name, last name, and the hierarchy path, which should be built using the employee id, separating levels with a slash.

```sql

```

Result:  


#### üìå C59: Write a query to list every manager from the employees table, along with the number of employees who report to him/her directly or indirectly.

The list must include 3 columns:

1) The employee id

2) The whole name of the employee, which would be built concatenating the first and last names separated by a blank space

3) The number of employees that report to him/her directly or indirectly.

HINT: You might need to use a subquery.


```sql

```

Result:
