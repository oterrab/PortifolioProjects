/*
Write a query to get the list of employees whose name includes the letter “O” 2 times, but not contiguously, so if there was a name “JOHN DOE”, it should be returned, but a row with name “JIM BROOKS” should not, because the 2 Os are contiguous.

Note: Since at this point we still don’t have the necessary knowledge to count the number of ‘O’s that appear in a string, assume that no name will contain more than 2 Os.

/*
Write a query to get the list of departments whose monthly budget is greater than 15000 and its name includes a “G” or starts with an “H”, sorted by the department id in descending order.

Warning: As mentioned in the lesson, the ability to use substitution variables is a feature of SQL Developer (and some other client tools), but this feature is not implemented by Live SQL and Apex, so if you try to run statements with substitution variables there you will get errors.

/*
Write a query to list employees who were hired between a certain range of dates (for example, between January 1st, 2011, and December 15th, 2014). The query must be written in a way that allows the user to use a different date range without needing to modify the query.
*/

/*
Write a query to list employees who work in a given department. The query must prompt the user to enter a value, and then return only employees whose salary is equal to the value entered, or equal to the half of the value entered or equal to a third of the value entered by the user.

The query must also prompt for the id of the department that the user wants to list.

Your script must include the command necessary to erase the value entered for the salary so that if the query is executed again, the user is prompted for the salary value again.
