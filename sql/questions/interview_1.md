# â™¾ Interview Questions

I'll be solving SQL questions and sharing my answers.

## ðŸ“Œ Context on this Job Interview

This interview was for a job as Developer Pl/SQL JÃºnior. They gave me as dataset the built-in oracle sql scott schema. This can be acessed using SQL Developer or at [Oracle Live](https://livesql.oracle.com/).


**Question 0:** <p align="justify"> Create a query for employees hired in <del>the last month.</del> </p>

Observation: The first time I did it wrong and instead of giving the last 30 days as asked in Question 1, I've wrote the code for last month. Rookie mistake. But since its a valid code, I`ve decided to leave it here.

```sql
/*
Because of the way the data is structured in the built-in oracle sql datasets,
we have replace sysdate with a specific date, for example, TO_DATE('04-12-1981', 'dd-mm-yyy') 
*/

SELECT ename, hiredate
FROM scott.emp
WHERE trunc(hiredate, 'MM') = add_months(trunc(sysdate, 'MM'), -1);
```

**Question 1:** <p align="justify"> Create a query for employees hired in the last 30 days. </p>

```sql
/*

we have replace sysdate with a specific date, for example, TO_DATE('04-12-1981', 'dd-mm-yyy') 
*/

SELECT ename, hiredate
FROM scott.emp
WHERE (hiredate BETWEEN sysdate - 30
                         AND sysdate
      OR hiredate BETWEEN ADD_MONTHS(sysdate, -12 ) - 30
                         AND ADD_MONTHS( sysdate, -12 )
);
```

**Question 2:** <p align="justify"> Create a query that returns the name and commission of each employee, returning 0 (zero) in the case of unfilled commission.</p>

```sql

**Question 3:** <p align="justify"> Create a query that returns the number of employees per department, including departments without employees.</p>

```sql
SELECT dept.dname, COUNT(emp.empno) AS count

GROUP BY dept.dname;
```

**Question 4:** <p align="justify"> Create a query that for each position returns the job of the employee with the lowest salary.</p>

```sql
/* 
There is more than one employee with the same position and lower salary, 
this query returns more than one employee. 
*/

SELECT empno, job, sal
FROM (
    SELECT E.*, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY job ORDER BY sal) rn
    FROM scott.emp E
) E
WHERE rn = 1;
```

```sql
/* 
This query returns the first employee and the salary. 
*/

SELECT
    job,
    MIN(sal) AS SAL,
    MIN(empno) KEEP(DENSE_RANK FIRST ORDER BY sal) empno
FROM scott.emp
GROUP BY job;
```

**Question 10:** <p align="justify"> Add a column in the EMP table, timely define the column type and find a solution so that every time an employee receives a raise, the amount of the last raise received is recorded in this new column.</p>

```sql
/* 
This was made on SQL Developer since we don't have privilegies to add triggers on Oracle Live
*/ 
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_sal
    BEFORE UPDATE OF sal ON scott.emp
    FOR EACH ROW
    WHEN (new.sal > old.sal)

    :new.comm := (:new.sal - :old.sal);
