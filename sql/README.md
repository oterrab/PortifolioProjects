# Courses

| Course | Description | SQL 'Flavour' |
|:---|---|:--:|
| üìä [SQL Made Practical](https://github.com/oterrab/portfolio-projects/tree/main/sql/oracle-sql-course) | <p align="justify"> Documentation of a SQL course I took. Course was created because most courses, if not all, focus too much on ‚Äútelling‚Äù or ‚Äúdemonstrating‚Äù how to do things, but don‚Äôt give the student the opportunity to test and practice what is being taught.  Every lesson in this course has a coding task to practice what I was learning. You will notice that some of the queries are a little off topic because I was exploring learning possibilities within the lesson. </p> **Course content:** 19 sections, 210 lectures and 16 h and 5 m total length. | Oracle SQL |
