## Resume

<br/>
<p align="justify">I've decided to start my research by trying to find loose threads in the dataset. To do that, I've started by analyzing gender ratio in purchases acorss branches. Interestingly, I've found that although gender ratio is roughly the same across all stores (50%), when you take a look closely at each branch, we see that in Naypyitaw (Branch B) there are almost 10% more Female costumers than in other branches. Other branches end up compensating for the gender ratio when we look at the big picture (<strong>Dashboard 1</strong>).</p>

<br/><p align='center'><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucas3607/viz/Marketing1_wb/Marketing1">Link to Dashboard 1 on Tableau Public</a></p><br/>

<p align='center'><img width="913" alt="Dashboard 1" src="https://github.com/oterrab/portfolio-projects/blob/main/sql/supermarket/output/dashboard1.png"></p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p align="justify">After noticing this difference I've decided to dig in more and researched for product lines differences between branches and in general. I've discovered that Naypyitaw (Branch B) is the only branch in which 'Sports and Travel' (S&T) is more consumed by women (<strong>Dashboard 1</strong>). Also, while S&T has the 2nd total amount sold in all branches, Naypyitaw (Branch B) is the branch which is selling worse (<strong>Dashboard 2</strong>).</p>

<br/><p align='center'><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucas3607/viz/Marketing1_wb/Marketing2">Link to Dashboard 2 on Tableau Public</a></p><br/>

<p align='center'><img width="913" alt="Dashboard 2" src="https://github.com/oterrab/portfolio-projects/blob/main/sql/supermarket/output/dashboard2.png"></p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p align="justify">After noticing this difference, I've decided to deepen my research at this point. My first reaction was think about difference in number os customers in each branch. I've saw that there was a slightly difference in number of customers, in which  Naypyitaw (Branch B) had the lowest number of customers, but it did not explain the bad performance. I've analyzed all factors that the dataset gave me, Customer Type, Unit Price, Tax, Payment Method, Gross Margin Percent and Quantity Sold.<br/>
<br/></p>

<p align="justify">I've noticed that Naypyitaw (Branch B) is paying 1% more taxes although the tax is 5% at all branches (not shown in dashboards). Additionaly, the price of each S&T product in Naypyitaw is 24% to 33% lower compared to other branches. This was very curious because this branch is paying 1% more taxes while selling less products (<strong>Dashboard 2</strong>), selling for less each product and generating less total amount sold. This made me think that there could be another factors responsible for this, Payment Method.<br/>
<br/></p>

<p align="justify">I've discovered that while credit card is the most used payment method in  Naypyitaw (Branch B), other branches have cash and ewallet as the most used payment method (<strong>Dashboard 2</strong>). So, my next natural reaction was to try to understand why consumers in  Naypyitaw (Branch B) use more credit cards than in other branches. I've discovered that members customers in general (all branches) usually pay using credit card. While every branch has similar number of members and normal customers, Naypyitaw has a lot more members (<strong>Dashboard 2</strong>).<br/>
<br/></p>

<p align="justify">In conclusion, I believe there is an opportunity in this branch to increase revenue. There are peculiarities that can be the target of company actions, whether marketing or policy change. Are they: <br/>
<br/></p>

- Naypyitaw (Branch B) has almost 10% more Female costumers than in other branches.
- Naypyitaw (Branch B) is the only branch in which 'Sports and Travel' (S&T) is more consumed by women.
- S&T unit price product in Naypyitaw is 24% to 33% lower compared to other branches. Are prices standard across branches? If so, it might be the kind of product in S&T that are being sold in this branch. **Need more data.** Also, Its this related to why Female customers are consuming more 'Sports and travel' products?
- Members are partially responsible for lower revenue in S&T products in Naypyitaw (Branch B) due to use of credit card as payment method.

<p align="justify">It might be interesting to keep researching and take a look at other data. For example, the dataset provides the days that purchases were made. Does this have any influence on branch revenue? The dataset does not have the age of the consumers. This may be a relevant factor considering that older consumers may buy less S&T. What is the age distribution of consumers and what is the age distribution of the city of Naypyitaw? <br/>
<br/></p>

## Line of Thoughts

### Which gender frequent more the supermarket?

```sql
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
GROUP BY gender;
```
<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="261" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 11 50 05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183254107-2daf80b4-9afc-46cd-ba04-44bb3933029b.png"></p>

<br/>
<p align='center'><strong>All about the same</strong></p>
<br/>

### And in each branch?

```sql
SELECT city,
       gender,
       COUNT(gender)                                                                   AS cnt_gender,
       ROUND((COUNT(gender) * 100) / (SUM(COUNT(gender)) OVER (PARTITION BY city)), 1) AS pct
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
GROUP BY city, gender
ORDER BY city;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="505" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 12 07 24" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183254813-db9ae47d-b50b-4930-b424-555b598e5cd8.png"></p>

<br/>
<p align='center'>Branch B in Naypyitaw has 328 costumers in which 178 (54,3%) are Female and 150 Male (45,7%).<br/>
  <strong>There are almost 10% more Female costumers.</strong><br/>
    Since its a interesting difference, let's dig in.</p>
<br/>

### Which product_line generate more revenue in Naypyitaw?

```sql
SELECT product_line, SUM(ROUND(total)) AS total
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE city = 'Naypyitaw'
GROUP BY product_line
ORDER BY SUM(total) DESC;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="370" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 12 09 46" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183254897-88e5a314-21d4-46dc-a0bd-0e8fa5776bce.png"></p>

<br/>
<p align='center'>'Food and beverages' is the product_line with most total revenue and 'Home and lifestyle' is the product_line with least total revenue.</p>
<br/>

### Is there any difference in costumer gender and product_line in Naypyitaw?

```sql
SELECT product_line, gender, SUM(ROUND(total)) AS total
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE city = 'Naypyitaw'
GROUP BY product_line, gender
ORDER BY product_line;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="495" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 12 11 35" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183254957-54bb4088-8225-437a-ab92-6e3049bc8017.png"></p>

<br/>
<p align='center'>It seems that 'Food and beverages' and 'Sports and travel' are most consumed by Female.<br/>
    While 'Health and Beauty' consumed most by Males.</p>
<br/>

### How this compare to other branches/cities?

<p align='center'><strong>'Food and beverages'</strong></p>

```sql
SELECT gender, city, SUM(ROUND(total)) AS total
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE product_line = 'Food and beverages'
GROUP BY city, gender
ORDER BY city;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="365" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 12 26 37" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183255477-e468f0b3-1ee6-404e-a58e-68a79b16460d.png"></p>

<br/>
<p align='center'><strong>'Sports and travel'</strong></p>

```sql
SELECT gender, city, SUM(ROUND(total)) AS total
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE product_line = 'Sports and travel'
GROUP BY city, gender
ORDER BY city;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="364" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 12 29 05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183255547-796e3141-1483-4600-bc7e-d498d78af4c6.png"></p>

<br/>
<p align='center'><strong>'Health and Beauty'</strong></p>

```sql
SELECT gender, city, SUM(ROUND(total)) AS total
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE product_line = 'Health and Beauty'
GROUP BY city, gender
ORDER BY city;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="363" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 12 30 10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183255576-209db414-ecc3-437d-bce5-c4de2991f894.png"></p>

<br/>

<br/>
<p align='center'>For 'Food and beverages' the trend is the same in Mandalay and Naypyitaw but inverse in Yangon.<br/>
    <strong>For 'Sports and travel' it seems that being the most product line consumed by Female is a unique feature of Naypyitaw.</strong><br/>
    For 'Health and Beauty' it seems that Naypyitaw is the inverse of Mandalay. While in Yangon male and female consume about the same amount.<br/>
<br/>
    So far, Naypyitaw is the city with more female costumers and they are consuming a lot of 'Sports and travel' products.<br/>
<br/></p>
<br/>


### Which product_line that generate more revenue in all branches?

```sql
SELECT product_line, SUM(ROUND(total)) AS total
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
GROUP BY product_line
ORDER BY SUM(total) DESC;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="368" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 12 35 53" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183255801-609fcec9-25e1-480b-85ef-15c206141317.png"></p>

<br/>

### Which gender spend most on each product line?

```sql
SELECT product_line, gender, SUM(ROUND(total)) AS total
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
GROUP BY product_line, gender
ORDER BY product_line, gender;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="497" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 12 37 05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183255842-70761d48-8d93-43ec-ac5e-225b201c00e6.png"></p>
<br/>

<br/>
<p align='center'>It seems that 'Health and Beauty' is the most profitable product line in general.<br/>
    So, nothing new being the best product_line in Naypyitaw. Home and lifestyle is also pretty low.<br/>
    <strong>Interestingly, 'Sports and travel' is the 2nd best product_line in general but the second worst in Naypyitaw.</strong></p>
<br/>

### How 'Sports and travel' are performing in each branch?

```sql
SELECT product_line, city, SUM(ROUND(total)) AS total
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE product_line = 'Sports and travel'
GROUP BY product_line, city;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="470" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 12 41 45" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183256003-1cb1b2ba-ec69-4a4f-a55f-1fb9690fac5c.png"></p>
<br/>


<br/>
<p align='center'><strong>Naypyitaw is doing really bad in 'Sports and travel'.<br/></p></strong>
<br/>
Evidences so far:<br/>
    - Naypyitaw is the city with 10% more female customers than male customers.<br/>
    - While Man consume more 'Sports and travel' products in other branches. In Naypyitaw, Females are consuming more 'Sports and travel' products.<br/>
<br/>
<br/><p align='center'>
    For some reason 'Sports and travel' are not performing well there.<br/>
    Maybe is happening not because of the high number of female costumers, but low number of male costumers?<br/></p>
<br/>
  
### How number of costumers compare in each branch/city?

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="224" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 12 45 24" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183256128-5b395b4f-56db-4113-987c-2e51aff6c569.png"></p>
<br/>

<br/>
<p align='center'>They are about the same. It seems that number of costumers are not a relevant factor for this difference.<br/>
    Then, <strong>why 'Sports and travel' products are performing poorly in this branch?</strong><br/>
<br/>
    This is interesting to investigate.<br/>
    Let's broaden our vision and take a look at other factors that might be contributing for this.<br/>
<br/>
    Besides number of costumers and gender, we have other factors that we can dig in.<br/></p>
    <strong>They are:</strong><br/>
    
```
    customer_type, is there any particular thing about this branch?
    unit_price, are the branches selling the same product?
    tax, different legislation?
    payment could be influencing?
    gross_margin_pct, branches have the same margin percentage?
    quantity sold is different?
```

<br/>
    <p align='center'>Gross Income is expected to be the same since the branch is performing bad with this product_line.</p><br/>
<br/>


### Tax, Gross Margin Percent and Gross Income comparison

```sql
SELECT city,
       SUM(quantity)            AS quantity,
       AVG(tax)                 AS tax,
       SUM(ROUND(gross_income)) AS gross_income,
       AVG(gross_margin_pct)    AS gross_percent
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE product_line = 'Sports and travel'
GROUP BY city;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="823" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 12 58 49" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183256582-4fa68945-b794-42dc-9c20-52058a2bb423.png"></p>
<br/>
<br/><p align='center'>
So, Gross Margin Percent is relative similar between branches.<br/>
Naypyitaw branch is selling less quantity of 'Sports and travel' products.<br/>
Naypyitaw branch is paying more taxes although the tax is 5% at all branches.<br/>
But still, 1% difference in taxes does not explain 20% difference in gross income.<br/>
And how this branch is paying more taxes while selling less products?<br/></p>
<br/>
<br/>
Evidences so far:<br/>
    - Naypyitaw is the city with 10% more female costumers than male costumer.<br/>
    - While Man consume more 'Sports and travel' products in other branches. In Naypyitaw, Females are consuming more 'Sports and travel' products.<br/>
    - Naypyitaw branch is selling less quantity of 'Sports and travel' products.<br/>
    - Tax amount paid in Naypyitaw are higher than in other branches.<br/>

### Unit Price

```sql
SELECT city, SUM(ROUND(unit_price)) AS total
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE product_line = 'Sports and travel'
GROUP BY city;
```


<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="243" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 13 05 41" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183256848-481943f5-4cb5-4f41-99fb-c92b1102b79b.png"></p>
<br/>

<br/><p align='center'>That's interesting. There is a difference between 24% and 33% in unit price.<br/></p>
<br/>

Evidences so far:<br/>
- Naypyitaw is the city with 10% more female customers than male customers.<br/>
- While Man consume more 'Sports and travel' products in other branches. In Naypyitaw, Females are consuming more 'Sports and travel' products.<br/>
- Naypyitaw branch is selling less quantity of 'Sports and travel' products.<br/>
- Tax amount paid in Naypyitaw are higher than in other branches.<br/>
- Price of each product in Naypyitaw is 24% to 33% lower.<br/>
<br/><p align='center'>
    It's a bit contradicting that Naypyitaw has lower price for each product and lower quantity but is paying higher tax amount.<br/></p>


### Is it due to payment type difference?

```sql
SELECT city, payment, COUNT(payment) AS cnt
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE product_line = 'Sports and travel'
GROUP BY city, payment
ORDER BY city;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="356" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 15 09 05" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183260848-5e44af5d-1125-4e0c-ad11-4e73505f167a.png"></p>
<br/>

<br/><p align='center'>Naypyitaw costumers are using more credit card than other payment methods.</p><br/>
<br/>
    Evidences so far:<br/>
    - Naypyitaw is the city with 10% more female customers than male customers.<br/>
    - While Man consume more 'Sports and travel' products in other branches. In Naypyitaw, Females are consuming more 'Sports and travel' products.<br/>
    - Naypyitaw branch is selling less quantity of 'Sports and travel' products.<br/>
    - Tax amount paid in Naypyitaw are higher than in other branches.<br/>
    - Price of each product in Naypyitaw is 24% to 33% lower.<br/>
    - Credit Card is the most used payment method in Naypyitaw. Other branches have Cash and Ewallet as most used payment method.<br/>
<br/>
<p align='center'>This last piece of evidence probably explains the contradiction between lower price for each product and higher tax amount.<br/></p>
    

### Does female costumers consume using more credit card?

```sql
SELECT city, gender, payment, COUNT(payment) AS cnt
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE product_line = 'Sports and travel'
  AND payment = 'Credit card'
GROUP BY city, gender
ORDER BY city, gender;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="477" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 15 13 32" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183261008-11b7aec2-9160-49cf-9f59-a0367aabba99.png"></p>
<br/>

<p align='center'>It seems that gender its not really a factor in this.<br/></p>
<br/> 

```sql
SELECT city, customer_type, payment, COUNT(payment) AS cnt
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE product_line = 'Sports and travel'
  AND payment = 'Credit card'
GROUP BY city, customer_type
ORDER BY city, customer_type;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="545" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 15 16 03" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183261113-43321b4f-9dc8-46ff-b9aa-e2399f952882.png"></p>
<br/>


<p align='center'>We found another piece of evidence.<br/> 
Members pay using more Credit Card than other payment methods.<br/></p>
<br/> 

Evidences so far:<br/> 
- Naypyitaw is the city with 10% more female customers than male customers.<br/> 
- While Man consume more 'Sports and travel' products in other branches. In Naypyitaw, Females are consuming more 'Sports and travel' products.<br/> 
- Naypyitaw branch is selling less quantity of 'Sports and travel' products.<br/> 
- Tax amount paid in Naypyitaw are higher than in other branches.<br/> 
- Price of each product in Naypyitaw is 24% to 33% lower.<br/> 
- Credit Card is the most used payment method in Naypyitaw. Other branches have Cash and Ewallet as most used payment method.<br/> 
- Members pay using more Credit Card in all branches.<br/> 
    
    
### Does this branch have more members?

```sql
SELECT city, customer_type, COUNT(customer_type) AS cnt
FROM supermarket.`supermarket_sales - Sheet1`
WHERE product_line = 'Sports and travel'
GROUP BY city, customer_type
ORDER BY city, customer_type;
```

<br/>
<p align='center'><img width="413" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-06 at 15 17 31" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59098085/183261157-c27f01e8-06f7-4d5b-affd-e28a398a5b5c.png"></p>
<br/>

<p align='center'>Another evidence. Every branch has similar number of members and normal customers, except for Naypyitaw that has a lot more members.
<br/></p>
<br/>

## Conclusions and Recommendations:


<p align="justify">In conclusion, I believe there is an opportunity in this branch to increase revenue. There are peculiarities that can be the target of company actions, whether marketing or policy change. Are they: <br/>
<br/></p>

- Naypyitaw (Branch B) has almost 10% more Female costumers than in other branches.
- Naypyitaw (Branch B) is the only branch in which 'Sports and Travel' (S&T) is more consumed by women.
- S&T unit price product in Naypyitaw is 24% to 33% lower compared to other branches. Are prices standard across branches? If so, it might be the kind of product in S&T that are being sold in this branch. **Need more data.** Also, Its this related to why Female customers are consuming more 'Sports and travel' products?
- Members are partially responsible for lower revenue in S&T products in Naypyitaw (Branch B) due to use of credit card as payment method.

<p align="justify">It might be interesting to keep researching and take a look at other data. For example, the dataset provides the days that purchases were made. Does this have any influence on branch revenue? The dataset does not have the age of the consumers. This may be a relevant factor considering that older consumers may buy less S&T. What is the age distribution of consumers and what is the age distribution of the city of Naypyitaw? <br/>
<br/></p>
