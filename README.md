# üó∫ Portfolio Guide

Hello üëã, is there anybody in there?

This is my Portfolio Summary where I provide a walkthrough to all of my forays into data analytics projects and courses. I'll track my projects here with a quick note on what each project does.

Feel free to chat with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucaspassosbarreto/) about my projects!

# Python

**Level:**

**Skills:** Data cleaning, wrangling, visualisation, analysis

**Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

| Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries | 
|:---|:--:|----|:--:|
| :pencil2: [Education in ES](https://github.com/oterrab/portfolio-projects/tree/main/python/educacao-es) |   Data Wrangling, <br /> EDA | <p align="justify"> A project close to üè° home. Analysis of educational data from my home state using data from the institute responsible for promoting studies, research and periodic evaluations on the Brazilian educational system - Which city has the most number os schools, How many students there are per school, How much does each city invest in its students? </p> | _pandas, seaborn, matplotlib_ |
| üìë [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/oterrab/portfolio-projects/tree/main/python/nlp-learning) |  Data Wrangling, EDA, <br /> Machine Learning | <p align="justify"> Analysis using NLP techniques to interpret text data that I was working with in my PhD and to learn some techniques I was going to use in other context. The text used to perform this analysis was a transcript of a chemistry class for undergraduation students. </p> | _pandas, scikit-learn, pickle, textblob, spacy, re, string, numpy, wordcloud, matplotlib_ |

# R

**Level:**

**Functions:**

**Libraries:** ggplot2

| Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries | 
|:---|----|----|:--:|
| üåä [LCT](https://github.com/oterrab/LCT-dev) |  Data Visualization | This was developed during my PhD. I will keep it private until fully prublished. | ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate |


***

# SQL

**Level:** Intermediate SQL

**Functions:** joins, subqueries, inline views, subquery factoring (WITH clause), row limiting clause, aggregate functions (count(), avg(), sum(), min(), max()), analytic functions (partition, windowing, ranking, LISTAGG, LAG, LEAD, FIRST, LAST, FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE), procedural functions, procedures.

| Project Name | Description | SQL 'Flavour' |
|:---|---|:--:|
| üìä [SQL Made Practical](https://github.com/oterrab/portfolio-projects/tree/main/sql/oracle-sql-course) | <p align="justify"> Documentation of a SQL course I took. Course was created because most courses, if not all, focus too much on ‚Äútelling‚Äù or ‚Äúdemonstrating‚Äù how to do things, but don‚Äôt give the student the opportunity to test and practice what is being taught.  Every lesson in this course has a coding task to practice what I was learning. You will notice that some of the queries are a little off topic because I was exploring learning possibilities within the lesson. </p> **Course content:** 19 sections, 210 lectures and 16 h and 5 m total length. | Oracle SQL |
| üîñ SQL Learning | **Temporary Section.** For now this is just queries that I used to practice SQL | PL/SQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server |
