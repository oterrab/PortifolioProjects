# Portifolio Projects to Learn Programming and Data Science

These will be my forays into learning techniques for data science. I'll track my
projects here with a quick note on what each project does.

## Natural Language Processing - NLP

This code I used NLP techniques to interpret text data that I was working with in my PhD. I did this before learning how to use Git, so in the future ill try to redo my coding so it's updated and with no leftover codes.

Text pre-processing techniques include tokenization, text normalization and data cleaning. Once in a standard format, various machine learning techniques can be applied to better understand the data. This includes using popular modeling techniques to score the sentiment of a text. To perform a sentiment analysis, I did a subjectivity score to understand how much the teacher speech was opiniated (if what he was saying was a objective fact or a subjective opinion) and a polarity score to understand if what he is talking is negative or positive.
