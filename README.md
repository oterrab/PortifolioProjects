Hello üëã, is there anybody in there?

This is my Portfolio Summary where I provide a walkthrough to all of my forays into data analytics projects and courses. I'll track my projects here with a quick note on what each project does.

Feel free to chat with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-passos-barreto-93b84351/) about my projects!
